# Surfs Up!
SurfsUp! is a CS:GO Surf inspired game with new competitive multiplayer elements. 

### Prerequisites
The Game is built on the Unity game engine so familiarity with Unity and the Unity editor is beneficial. It is also recommended that you have Unity installed. 

### Getting Started 
Use git or the download button to download the game source code. Or clone the project through the command line. 
Open the project in unity. The game can be run in the unity editor or a build of the game can be made for your particular system. 
The server for the game lobby is not currently active so you will not be able to play multiplayer or even solo games. However, you can still see the game in action by downloading the SurfsUpDemoVideo.mp4 file.
